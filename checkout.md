## Introduction

As part of our recruitment process, we ask potential employees to take our “Code
Challenge”. This is a small project designed to allow you to showcase your software
development skills and demonstrate good object-oriented principles and design.

## The Challenge

Implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of
items. In a normal supermarket, items are identified using Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), but
in our store we’ll be using individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C etc). Our goods are
priced individually, but some items also have multibuy offers. For example, item A might cost
60 individually, but if you buy three A’s then they’ll cost you 150. This week’s prices are as
follows:

```
Item Unit Price Special Price
A    60          3 for 150
B    30          2 for 45
C    30
D    25
```

Items can be scanned in any order, so if we scan a B, an A, then another B, we’ll recognise
the offer for two B’s and price them at 45, giving a total price of 105.

Because our store changes its pricing frequently,
we need to be able to pass in a set of pricing rules each time we begin handling a checkout transaction.

You may use any language and technologies to design and implement your solution.
The interface for the checkout should look similar to the following pseudocode:

checkout = new Checkout(pricingRules)
checkout.Scan(item)
checkout.Scan(item)
...
price = checkout.Total

Here are some example totals for sequences of items,
which you may find useful for testing your solution.

```
Items       Total
A            60
A B          90
C D B A      145
A A          120
A A A        150
A A A A      210
A A A A A    270
A A A A A A  300
A A A B      180
A A A B B    195
A A A B B D  220
D A B A B A  220
```

## Submission

Please upload your solution (including any instructions to build/run) to a public repository on
GitHub. Once uploaded, email neil.kilbride@redstor.com with the details.

Good luck!
